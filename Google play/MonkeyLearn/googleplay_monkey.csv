Zach Anderson,"Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice.",Positive,0.974
Oluwatunmise Alake,"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ...

If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.",Negative,0.972

Saksham Khurana,"Using this app for atleast 5+ yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature !! I mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that's unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start. Goodbye Todoist Edit (after reply): So you mean, me & every other person who is complaining are all wrong. Reminders were never premium until some time ago. I was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan. Have courtesy to not lie atleast :(",Negative,0.9
Brad Stanley,"I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this.

Martin Butt,"Constantly buggy. I've used this app for five years, and they are always pushing bad releases. Right now there is a crash expanding lists, which would have been found with some quick testing. Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months.

Leon Botha,"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes.",Negative,0.998

Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily.
